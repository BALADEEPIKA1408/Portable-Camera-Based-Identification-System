# Portable-Camera-Based-Identification-System
A project developed with a social motive of providing the blind people an immediate resolution to their day-to-day struggles of knowing their immediate surrounding objects along with its distance via auditory commands. The proposed system has the potential to greatly enhance the independence and mobility of visually impaired individuals by providing real-time feedback about their environment. The system is composed of several components, including a camera module, a processor, and feedback mechanisms, and can also include other sensors such as an ultrasonic sensor or a Raspberry Pi.

Utilized cutting-edge machine learning techniques, including SSD algorithm for object detection, which is a deep learning algorithm that is trained to recognize objects in images Attained remarkable model accuracy scoring 85%.
